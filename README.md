## Requirements

- HashiCorp Packer `1.9.0` or [newer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads)
- Docker `24.0.0` or [newer](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - alternate compatible runtimes (e.g.: Podman, OrbStack) may be used
- a check-out of [@workloads/tooling](https://github.com/workloads/tooling)

Optional, and only needed for development and testing of Container Images:

- `terraform-docs` `0.16.0` or [newer](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/)

## Usage

This repository provides a workflow that is wrapped through a [Makefile](./Makefile).

Running `make` without commands will print out the following help information:

```text

yaml_lint         lint YAML files                                 `make yaml_lint`
_registry_login   log in to a (Docker) Registry                   `make _registry_login`
help              display a list of Make Targets                  `make help`
_listincludes     list all included Makefiles and *.mk files      `make _listincludes`
_selfcheck        lint Makefile                                   `make _selfcheck`
```

> All workflows _may_ be executed manually, though this is not advisable. See the [Makefile](./Makefile) for more information.

## Notes

### Publishing Images

Images may be pushed to a Container Registry by setting the `push` flag to `true` as part of the `make build` target.

This will run the [`docker-push`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/post-processors/docker/docker-push) Post Processor as part of the Packer build process.

### Security Scanning

Images may be scanned for security concerns using [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/) with the `make snyk_test` command.

> **Note**
> The `snyk_test` target requires the Snyk CLI to be [authenticated](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/authenticate-the-cli-with-your-account) with the Snyk API.

### Development Helpers

The [Makefile](./Makefile) includes several unsupported helper targets that _may_ be useful when developing additional templates and functionality.

These targets are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) and may be removed at any time.

### Colored Output

Colorized CLI output may be disabled by setting the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to any non-empty value.

```shell
export NO_COLOR=1 && make
```
